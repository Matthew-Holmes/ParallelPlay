Steps:

0. Prepare documentation (will document ongoing)

1. Decide on requirements for short, medium and long term; then decide requirements for first version

2. Scope out libraries to use; narrowing down to a shortlist 

3. Plan and produce a prototype, bare-bones version that can be used to trial libraries

4. See which libraries are best (1 branch per library), in terms of ease of use

5. Prepare test framework and write some initial tests

6. Produce version 1, incorporating tests as development continues
