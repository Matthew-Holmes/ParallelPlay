# Requirements

The goal of this project is to produce a program that computes a bitmap image, split into sections, with each section being computed concurrently,

the project will serve as a testbed for parallel processing libraries and techniques; as well as image handling tools

## Short Term

Running the program will bring up a window displaying an updating bitmap, with the number of sections and other options loaded from a config file,

The sections will be generated by something moderately computationally intensive, for example an equation solve,

Logging output will be produced to analyse the performance of the code, saved into a separate file

## Medium Term

Multiple parallel processing paradigms will be implemented and basic performance testing implemented to compare them, with options to choose the number of cores/threads used

## Long term

In the longer term the primary goal of computing bitmap images is a lesser concern, the aim is to trial different processing techniques and to effectively be able to swap between different user code and compare the outputs; build tools and compilation will be important
